# super16
A strange little 16bit ISA/Architecture.  
  
## Theory
One instruction is composed of 32 bits, making up 3 catagories; Opcode, Register and data. The opcode is two hexadecimal digits, the register is another two, and the data is a 4-digit hexadecimal number split into two two-digit numbers. Here is an example instruction loading ```0xf988``` into ```r5```:  
| Opcode | Register | Data 1 | Data 2 |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 0x20   | 0x05     | 0xf9   | 0x88   |
  
The full list of opcodes, as well as an example, the instruction & explaination are as follows:  
| opcode | instruction |                                                                             |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|        |             | Copy value from one reg to another                                          |

## Installing
Run ```git clone https://github.com/l3gacyb3ta/super16.git && cd super16```, then run whatever command you like! Examples are bellow in the example commands section.  
  
## How to run with emulator
As I have not yet learned how to build an actual sim in logisim or similar software (so many sim-s!), I have implemented this ISA in python. After running ```assembler.py``` with a valid asembly file as an argument, a pickle file named rom.pic will appear. In order to run it, simply execute ```cpu.py``` for normal use, and ```slowpu.py``` for debugging.  
  
## Binary compiling
In order to compile to a binary that would run on a theoretical S16 cpu, simply invoke ```binaryassembler.py``` with the asembley file as a parameter.  
  
## Examples
A set of example programs are provided in the ```tests/``` directory. This is a great place to begin programming for S16. I have also included a script ```test.sh``` to run a test file. To do that, simply run ```test.sh``` and type the name (without .asm) of the file you want to run, and it should run.  
  
## Example commands
* Running an assembly file:
```
$ python assembler.py tests/scrn.asm
$ python cpu.py
```
* Compiling to a binary:
```
$ python binaryassembler.py tests/scrn.asm
```
